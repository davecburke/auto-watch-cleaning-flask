# auto-watch-cleaning-flask

Watch cleaning machines make the cleaning of mechanical watches both convenient and very effective but they can be expensive with most manual machines starting at around $1000 AUD and automatic machines starting at around $8,000 AUD. This is a big expense for a hobbiest like me.

It dawned on me that a 3D printer could be converted into a watch cleaning machine by replacing the hotend on the X axis with a spinning motor. How hard could it be, right!

## Specifications
- Fully automatic
- 1 x Cleaning Chamber
- 2 x Rinse Chamber
- 1 x Drying Chamber
NB: I've decided to make it easier for myself so I purchases the Elma SE Basket Complete and the Elma Basket Holder for RM/SE. You could of course rig up your own basket system on the cheap

## Features
The cleaning stage and the two rinse stages consist of two phases, the wash/rinse phase and the spin phase to expel liquid. The drying stage only has a spin phase.  All features are configured via a configuration file. These include:
- Setting the duration of each phase of the clean
- Setting the motor speed for each phase of the clean
- Setting the motor action for each phase of the clean. These are forward, backward and agitate (a user configured combination of forward and backward movements)
